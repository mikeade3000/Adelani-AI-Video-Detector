## Doc-to-Video (`doc-to-video/`)

Turns **PowerPoint (.pptx)**, **Word (.docx)** and **PDF** files into narrated **MP4** videos.

1. **Upload** a file. Slides, headings/sections or pages are read in the browser; the file is never uploaded.
2. **Choose the voice and settings**: female or male narrator (5 voices each, American or British), speaking speed, maximum video length (3, 3½ or 4 minutes), slide style, colour theme, 720p or 1080p, and subtitles.
3. **Instructions**: describe the tone, audience and level of detail you want. If you tick *Let AI write the narration* and paste an Anthropic API key, Claude rewrites the narration and on-screen points to follow your instructions. Without a key, the narration comes from the speaker notes, or from the slide/page text, plus an optional opening and closing line.
4. **Review the script**: every slide's title, on-screen points and narration can be edited before rendering.
5. **Generate**: the narration is recorded with the voice model, then the videos are built. When the narration is longer than the limit, it is split into *Part 1 of N*, *Part 2 of N* and so on. Each part starts with a title card and stays under the limit. If a single slide's narration is longer than the limit, that slide is continued in the next part.

### How it works

Everything runs client-side, so the site can be hosted on GitHub Pages or any static host:

| Step | Library |
|---|---|
| PPTX / DOCX reading | [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) + the browser's XML parser |
| PDF reading and page rendering | [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) |
| Voice (text-to-speech) | [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX) via `kokoro-js`. Uses WebGPU when available, otherwise several CPU workers. The ~90 MB model downloads once and is then cached. |
| AI script writing (optional) | Claude via the Anthropic JavaScript SDK, called from the browser with the user's own key |
| MP4 encoding | WebCodecs (H.264 + AAC) and `mp4-muxer` |

### Browser support

Use **desktop Chrome or Edge**. On Windows and macOS the audio is AAC. On Linux, Chrome has no AAC encoder, so the MP4 uses Opus audio, which plays in Chrome, Firefox and VLC.

### Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/doc-to-video/. Pages must be served over http(s), not opened as `file://`, because they use JavaScript modules and workers.

### Limitations

- PowerPoint slides are **redrawn** in a clean template (title, bullet points, the main picture). They are not pixel-perfect copies of the original design. For exact visuals, export the deck to PDF and use **Original pages** style.
- Old `.ppt` / `.doc` files must be re-saved as `.pptx` / `.docx`.
- Scanned PDFs (images without text) have no text to read. Type the narration in the script step, or use AI mode.
- Voice generation speed depends on the computer. A GPU (WebGPU) is much faster than CPU.
